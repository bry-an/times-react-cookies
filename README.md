# Clean NYT
## About
Clean NYT provides a quick interface to search New York Times articles. If an optional date window is specified, only articles published within that window will be returned. Users can also save articles to read later. 

## Target Audience
This app is aimed at people who want to search the New York Times but don't want the clutter or tediousness of using the Times' site. Users can find what they want, read it now or later, and get on with their day. 

## Technologies
This app is a full-stack React.js single-page-app with an Express backend and Mongo database for saving articles.
